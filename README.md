### If you don't have python installed
DevScript requires Python to be installed on your system. Once installed, you can write and run DevScript code from any code editor.
Don't want to install Python locally?
No worries â€” you can use an online code editor like [Replit](https://replit.com/):
- Go to Replit
- Create a new Python project
- Build full Python programs just by explaining what you want to do
- Start coding in DevScript â€” it's that simple!

## Setup
After installation, run:
```
devscript setup
```
You'll be asked to enter your API key for authentication. Enter : devscript-test-key-123 for free access

## Writing DevScript Files
DevScript files use the `.ds` extension.
### **Example1:**
```
Print Hello DevScript!
```

### **Example2:**
```
analyse accident_prediction_india.csv
plot a pie chart according to the number of accidents to the "Day of Week"
use red color to indicate most number of accidents
save it to week.jpeg
```

### **Example3:**
```
analyse heart.csv
count number of patients to the Pre-existing Conditions
Save this to patients.csv
calculate the most number of patients to the Pre-existing Conditions
print The majority of patients were already suffering from "Pre-existing Conditions"
```

```
### Convert to Python:
```
devscript convert hello.ds
```
Python code is saved in the `generated_py` folder.
### Convert and Run:
```
devscript convert hello.ds --run
```
### Check API usage:
```
devscript usage
```

- Make sure you've run `devscript setup`
- Check API status: `devscript usage`
- Config is stored in: `~/.devscript/config.json`

**Connection Issues:**
- Check internet connection  
- Ensure nothing is blocking the network  
- Debug with:
```
DEVSCRIPT_DEBUG=1 devscript run file.ds
```
