# DevScript

**DevScript** is an AI-powered coding language.
---

## Features

- Write code in plain English  
- Auto-converts to Python behind the scenes  
- Built-in CSV/data analysis support  
- Works locally with API key authentication  
- Simple CLI interface

---

## Installation

DevScript isn't on PyPI yet, so install it from GitHub:

### Option 1: Clone & Install

```
git clone https://github.com/ibedevesh/DevScript.git
cd DevScript
pip install -e .
```

### Option 2: Install Direct from GitHub

```
pip install git+https://github.com/ibedevesh/DevScript.git
```

---

## Setup

After installation, run:

```
devscript setup
```

Youâ€™ll be asked to enter your API key for authentication.

## Writing DevScript Files

DevScript files use the `.ds` extension.

### Example1: Analyze a CSV

```
analyze "customers.csv"
group by Country
Count how many customers are from each Country
save it to "country_count.csv"

```
âœ… This reads a CSV, groups customers by country, and saves the result â€” all with just 3 lines.
---

### Example2: Filter Missing Data

```
analyze "customers.csv"
display Customer Id where either Phone 1 or Phone 2 are missing
save it to "missing_contacts.csv"

```
âœ… This finds incomplete phone data and saves the filtered list.
---

### Example3: Plotting a Graph

```
analyze "sales.csv"
group by Category
plot a bar chart of Sales vs Category

```
âœ… One line to generate a graph. Visual magic.
---

### Example4: Basic Stats

```
analyze "data.csv"
calculate the average of Revenue
calculate the max of Revenue
print the results

```
âœ… Get quick insights without writing a single loop.

## Usage

### Run a DevScript file:

```
devscript run hello.ds
```

### Convert to Python:

```
devscript convert hello.ds
```

Python code is saved in the `generated_py` folder.

### Convert and Run:

```
devscript convert hello.ds --run
```

### Check API usage:

```
devscript usage
```

## Example: Math and Loops

```
# Print numbers from 1 to 5
for i from 1 to 5:
    print "Number: " + i

# Create a list of values
numbers = [100, 200, 300]

# Perform operations
calculate the average of numbers
calculate the sum of numbers
print "Total is: " + total
```

## Example: CSV Analysis

```
analyze "customers.csv"

group by Country
Count how many customers are from each Country

save it to "country_count.csv"
```

## Troubleshooting

**API Key Issues:**

- Make sure youâ€™ve run `devscript setup`
- Check API status: `devscript usage`
- Config is stored in: `~/.devscript/config.json`

**Connection Issues:**

- Check internet connection  
- Ensure nothing is blocking the network  
- Debug with:
```
DEVSCRIPT_DEBUG=1 devscript run file.ds
```
